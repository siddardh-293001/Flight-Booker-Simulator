Project Title: Flight Booking Simulator with Dynamic Pricing
________________________________________
Project Statement:
This project aims to develop a web-based Flight Booking Simulator that mimics real-world airline reservation systems, incorporating a dynamic pricing engine. The system allows users to search for flights, view fares that adjust based on time, seat availability, and simulated demand, and complete a multi-step booking process. This project focuses on the integration of a robust backend for managing dynamic fare calculations, seat inventory, and concurrent booking transactions. Through full-stack implementation, students will gain experience in API development, database design, pricing algorithms, and building reliable transactional systems.

Outcomes:
• A functional flight booking simulator with a responsive web interface
• Dynamic pricing algorithm based on simulated demand, seat inventory, and time to departure
• Backend API for flight search, pricing, booking, and cancellation
• Database design supporting transactional consistency and concurrent seat management
• Generation of booking confirmations (PNRs) and downloadable receipts
• Understanding of concurrency control and full-stack integration techniques
